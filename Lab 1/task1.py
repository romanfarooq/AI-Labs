# Here are the values of each of the Python expressions you provided:

# a. 250 (integer) 

# b. 3 (integer) 

# c. 250.0 (floating point) 

# d. 300000.0 (floating point) 

# e. 300000 (integer) f. 90 (integer)

# The expression 20 + 35 * 2 is different from (20 + 35) * 2 because of the order of operations in Python. In the first expression, Python first multiplies 35 by 2, then adds 20 to the result. In the second expression, Python first adds 20 and 35, then multiplies the result by 2.

# g. 2.0 (floating point) h. 0 (integer)

# The expression 2 / 3 * 3 is different from 2 // 3 * 3 because of the difference between floating-point division (/) and integer division (//) in Python. In the first expression, Python performs floating-point division of 2 by 3, which results in a floating-point number (0.6666666666666666). This number is then multiplied by 3, resulting in a floating-point number (2.0). In the second expression, Python performs integer division of 2 by 3, which results in an integer (0). This integer is then multiplied by 3, resulting in an integer (0).

# i. 11 (integer)

# This expression is different from both ((25 - 5) * 2) - 9 and 25 - ((5 * 2) - 9). The order of operations in Python dictates that multiplication and division should be performed before addition and subtraction. Therefore, Python first multiplies 5 and 2, then subtracts the result from 25, then subtracts 9 from that result.
