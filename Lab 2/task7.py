# Here's how you can create a list a containing three tuples:

a = [(1), (2, 3), (4, 5, 6)]

# Here's how you can print the second element of the second element of a:

print(a[1][1])

# Here's how you can create a list b containing four lists, each of which contains four elements:

b = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]]

# Here's how you can print the last two elements of the first element of b:

print(b[0][-2:])
